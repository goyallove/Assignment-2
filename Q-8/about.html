        <h3>About IET</h3>
        <p>
            Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya, Indore has been a leading university of central India. 
            The University within the framework of its UTD opened a self-financing engineering 
            institute named <strong>Institute of Engineering & Technology (IET)</strong>. It started its 
            academic journey on <strong>04 September 1996</strong>. It has been popularly known as IET-DAVV.
        </p>
        <p>
            IET was started with a total intake of 90 students in three branches of 
            Bachelor of Engineering (BE) - Mechanical Engineering, Computer Engineering, 
            and Electronics & Instrumentation Engineering, with 30 students each. The first 
            batch of these 90 students started their engineering career while studying 
            in the classrooms of the sister UTD - School of Computer Science (SCS) and 
            had got initial financial support from the other UTD - International Institute 
            of Professional Studies (IIPS).
        </p>
        <p>
            It is an approved institution by the <strong>All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE)</strong>, 
            New Delhi, Government of Madhya Pradesh, and University Grants Commission (UGC). 
            IET is academically autonomous with flexible and modern curriculum in all 
            branches of engineering. It is a fully self-financing institute offering 
            BE programmes in six branches. Recently, AICTE has approved an additional 
            intake of 180 students, making the total intake of 540 students per year.

            with six specializations. In the year 2006, an MSc program in Applied Mathematics 
            was also started.

        <p>
            The PhD programme is also offered in all disciplines of BE/ME Programmes & all 
            relevant areas of interest. The research component of IET is strong, with many 
            research scholars from reputed organizations such as SGSITS, AICTE, RRCAT, NRCS, 
            IITR, etc., registering for PhD programmes in various departments of IET.
